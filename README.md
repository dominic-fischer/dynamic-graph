A dynamic visualisation of the social networks found in Swiss Reformer Heinrich Bullinger's correspondence, accessible [here](https://dominic-fischer.github.io/dynamic-graph/).

It is based on the letter corpus digitised as part of the **Bullinger Digital** project ([website](https://www.bullinger-digital.ch/index.html), [repo](https://github.com/bullinger-digital)). The letters contain marked greeting formulas, which are used to infer the social networks surrounding Bullinger. For a detailed description of how these greeting data were processed to produce this visualisation, see [here](https://github.com/dominic-fischer/bullinger-saluta).

**Note**: The visualisation and its documentation are still under development.
